## Project Overview

This project is my personal endeavor to apply the knowledge gained from learning [Next.js React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/) by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller. Unlike the tutorial, I've chosen to develop this project entirely in TypeScript, embracing its strong typing and enhanced developer experience.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, or provide feedback. Let's continue the learning journey together!
